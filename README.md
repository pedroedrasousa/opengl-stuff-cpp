# C++ OpenGL Engine

This is the source code of an OpenGL graphics engine I wrote back in 2006 using C++, at least part of it.
I didn't have the time to organize the code nor to compile specific demos. I just took the cpp and header files and committed everything as-is. Project files and assets are not included.
You can find some demos at http://www.pedroedrasousa.com/.
Nevertheless the source code may be useful to someone. I found it mostly useful when I started writing a graphics engine for Android.

###Some features:

* Bitmap Image Processing
* Per-Pixel Lighting
* Projective Texturing
* Stencil Shadow Volumes
* Post Processing Shaders
* Frustum Culling
* Quadtrees
* Useful math stuff (Vectors, Matrices, B-Splines, etc.)
